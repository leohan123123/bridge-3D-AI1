# Added Flask because the current app.py uses it for the UI and mock API.
# This can be removed if app.py is fully converted to FastAPI and another solution for serving HTML/static is used with FastAPI.
Flask==3.0.0 # Or a version compatible with your Jinja2 if there are issues. Let's use a recent one.
