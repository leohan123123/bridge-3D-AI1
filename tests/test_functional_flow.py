# Developer Notes:
# - The test case `test_full_design_flow` covers the main path of BridgeService.
# - It includes a basic mechanism to handle placeholder API keys for DeepSeek,
#   allowing the test to proceed and check failover or error handling.
# - Assertions are made on key aspects of the design output based on the input.
# - The actual content of LLM-generated fields is variable, so checks are often
#   keyword-based or look for presence of expected information.
# - For more deterministic LLM-dependent tests, mocking LLMService responses
#   would be necessary.
